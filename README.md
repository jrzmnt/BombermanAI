## Abstract

Artificial Intelligence (AI) seeks to bring intelligent behavior for machines by using specific techniques. These techniques can be employed in order to solve tasks, such as planning paths or controlling intelligent agents. Some tasks that use AI techniques are not trivially testable, since it can handle a high number of variables depending on their complexity. As digital games can provide a wide range of variables, they become an efficient and economical means for testing artificial intelligence techniques. In this paper, we propose a combination of a behavior tree and a Pathfinding algorithm to solve a maze-based problem using the digital game Bomberman of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) platform. We perform an analysis of the AI techniques in order to verify the feasibility of future experiments in similar complex environments. Our experiments show that our intelligent agent can be successfully implemented using the proposed approach.
